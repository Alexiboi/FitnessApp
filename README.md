Fitness App targeted towards lifters especially.

# MVP
1. Allow users to create their own workouts
   displaying the exercise along with the number of sets, reps and weight (if applicable e.g. body weight exercises). 
2. Allow users to update, add and delete individual workouts.
3. Allow users to create workout templates for different muscle groups e.g. (legs, push, pull...)

4. Allow users to assign these workout templates to days of the week and then display a calendar showing the days when they have a workout.

5. Allow users to mark workouts as complete and prompt them to update the amount of reps and weight they did incase there was a change for this week.
6. Give users a statistical analysis of how much they have improved in terms of strength or stamina. For example if the amount of reps/weight they lift has increased this should be displayed to the user.
